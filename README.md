## Proposal 3 - Save the Vending Machine

1. Introduction to the problem statement
        There are more than 7 million vending machines serving people in the U.S.
    every day, and these add up to a market more than 8 billion dollars. However,
    seeing the desired item being out-of-stock is one of the most disappointing
    moment. In fact, vending machines being out-of-stock are estimated to be at
    least 3% in lost sales. Therefore, having an interactive web app that helps
    tracking the stock information becomes crutial to improve the business.

2. Abstract (rough draft)
        We will be building a web application that allows suppliers to better
    monitor their vending machines supplies. We will also provide several ways
    for suppliers receive low stock alerts, including automatic stock updates
    API (for Internet connected vending machines) and a consumer updates flow
    that will allow consumers to upload a picture of the vending machine.

3. Approach
    * Node.js server and PostgreSQL DB to store stock & user information.
    * React front end with different view for consumers and suppliers
    * Deploy the app on AWS


4. Persona
    - Supplier: Suppliers will be able to see all their vending machines on a
                list, with different icon shows different level of stocks. They
                will also be able to implement our API with their machines to
                automatically updates stock information in our system, and get
                alerted when stock of any item falls below a pre-defined
                threshold.
    - Consumer: Consumers can help improve the accuracy of stock information
                by uploading a picture of a specific vending machine, and we
                will be able to gather stock info from that picture.
